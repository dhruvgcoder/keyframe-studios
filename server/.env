# Email Configuration
# Replace with your actual email credentials

# Gmail Example:
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=sthetickpriv1@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=ndivttaxtyeiftfp
EMAIL_TO=me@dhruvx.dev

# For Gmail, you need to:
# 1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
# 2. Generate an "App Password" at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 3. Use that app password as EMAIL_PASS (not your regular password)

# Other email services (uncomment and configure as needed):
# EMAIL_SERVICE=outlook
# EMAIL_SERVICE=yahoo
# Or use custom SMTP:
# EMAIL_HOST=smtp.yourprovider.com
# EMAIL_PORT=587
